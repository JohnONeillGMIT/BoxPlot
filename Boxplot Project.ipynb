    "A Boxplot shows a Distribution summary in a contensed graph.\n",

    "There were earlier versions of the boxplot referred to earlier than Tukey's refinement.

    "\n",
    "The basic graphic form of the boxplot, the range-bar, was established in the early 1950’s Spear (1952, pg.164). Tukey’s contribution was to think deeply about appropriate summary statistics that worked for a wide\n",
    "range of data and to connect those to the visual components of the range bar. Today, what we call a boxplot is more closely related to what Tukey called a schematic plot, a box and whiskers plot with some special\n",

    "A box-and-whisker plot (sometimes called simply a box plot) is a histogram-like method of displaying data, invented by J. Tukey. To create a box-and-whisker plot, draw a box with ends at the quartiles Q_1 and Q_3. Draw the statistical median M as a horizontal line in the box. Now extend the \"whiskers\" to the farthest points that are not outliers (i.e., that are within 3/2 times the interquartile range of Q_1 and Q_3). Then, for every point more than 3/2 times the interquartile range from the end of a box, draw a dot. If two dots have the same value, draw them side by side (Gonick and Smith 1993, p. 21). Box-and-whisker plots are implemented as BoxWhiskerPlot[data] in the Wolfram Language package StatisticalPlots` .\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of other slightly different conventions are sometimes used. In Tukey's original definition, the closely-related and lesser known hinges H_1 and H_3 were used instead of Q_1 and Q_3 (Tukey 1977, p. 39). In addition, Tukey's original formulation lacked horizontal crossbars, extended the whiskers all the way to the extreme data points, and drew an unfilled dot at the maximum and a hatched horizontal strip at the minimum, as illustrated above (left figure; Tukey 1977, p. 40). A variation extended the whiskers only out to some arbitrary minimum and maximum values and identifying the outliers with explicit labels (Tukey 1977, p. 41). Tukey also considered an additional variation in which the outliers are indicated separately and whiskers are dashed, ending with dashed crossbars at \"adjacent values\" (values closest to but still inside the inner fences).\n",

    "\"The box plot (a.k.a. box and whisker diagram) is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. In the simplest box plot the central rectangle spans the first quartile to the third quartile (the interquartile range or IQR). A segment inside the rectangle shows the median and \"whiskers\" above and below the box show the locations of the minimum and maximum.\"\n",
    "http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/box2.html\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplest possible box plot displays the full range of variation (from min to max), the likely range of variation (the IQR), and a typical value (the median). Not uncommonly real datasets will display surprisingly high maximums or surprisingly low minimums called outliers. John Tukey has provided a precise definition for two types of outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers are either 3×IQR or more above the third quartile or 3×IQR or more below the first quartile.\n",
    "Suspected outliers are are slightly more central versions of outliers: either 1.5×IQR or more above the third quartile or 1.5×IQR or more below the first quartile.\n",
    "If either type of outlier is present the whisker on the appropriate side is taken to 1.5×IQR from the quartile (the \"inner fence\") rather than the max or min, and individual outlying data points are displayed as unfilled circles (for suspected outliers) or filled circles (for outliers). (The \"outer fence\" is 3×IQR from the quartile.)\n",
    "\n",
    "f the data happens to be normally distributed,\n",
    "\n",
    "IQR = 1.35 σ\n",
    "\n",
    "where σ is the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suspected outliers are not uncommon in large normally distributed datasets (say more than 100 data-points). Outliers are expected in normally distributed datasets with more than about 10,000 data-points. Here is an example of 1000 normally distributed data displayed as a box plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that outliers are not necessarily \"bad\" data-points; indeed they may well be the most important, most information rich, part of the dataset. Under no circumstances should they be automatically removed from the dataset. Outliers may deserve special consideration: they may be the key to the phenomenon under study or the result of human blunders.\n",
    "\n",
    "One case of particular concern --where a box plot can be deceptive-- is when the data are distributed into \"two lumps\" rather than the \"one lump\" cases we've considered so far.\n",
    "A \"bee swarm\" plot shows that in this dataset there are lots of data near 10 and 15 but relatively few in between. See that a box plot would not give you any evidence of this.\n",

    "\n",
    "Definition: A box-and-whisker plot or boxplot is a diagram based on the five-number summary of a data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in any box-and-whisker plot, the left-side whisker represents where we find approximately the lowest 25% of the data and the right-side whisker represents where we find approximately the highest 25% of the data. The box part represents the interquartile range and represents approximately the middle 50% of all the data. The data is divided into four regions, which each represent approximately 25% of the data. This gives us a nice visual representation of how the data is spread out across the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The minimum value of a data set is the least value in the set.\n",
    "* The maximum value of a data set is the greatest value in the set.\n",
    " *The range of a data set is the distance between the maximum and minimum value. To compute the range of a data set, we subtract the minimum from the maximum:\n",
    "range = maximum – minimum.\n",
    "* The interquartile range of a data set is the distance between the two quartiles.\n",
    "Interquartile range = Q3 – Q1.\n",
    "* The lower half of a data set is the set of all values that are to the left of the median value when the data has been put into increasing order.\n",
    "* The upper half of a data set is the set of all values that are to the right of the median value when the data has been put into increasing order.\n",
    "* The first quartile, denoted by Q1 , is the median of the lower half of the data set. This means that about 25% of the numbers in the data set lie below Q1 and about 75% lie above Q1 .\n",
    "* The third quartile, denoted by Q3 , is the median of the upper half of the data set. This means that about 75% of the numbers in the data set lie below Q3 and about 25% lie above Q3 .\n",
    "* A data set is any finite set of real numbers.  \n",
    "* A data set is in increasing order if the numbers in the data set are arranged from the least value to greatest value with the least value on the left and the greatest value on the right.\n",
    "* The median of a data set is the number that, when the set is put into increasing order, divides the data into two equal parts.  \n",
    "* If a data set has an odd number of data points, then the median is the middle data value (when the data is in increasing order).\n",
    "* If a data set has an even number of data points, then the median is the mean of the two middle data values (when the data is in increasing order).\n",
